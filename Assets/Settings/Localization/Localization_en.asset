    m_Localized: "And it came to pass in this age of dark wickedness, that pestilence
      did invade the face of the earth, and the harvests did perish, and the beasts
      of the field were smitten with madness. The earth did weep with countless sorrows,
      and disease did cover the nations as a thick cloud doth cover the angry heavens.
      For the Adversary, who is called Satan, did arise once more before the Eternal
      and did say in his heart: \u201CAre they not all inclined to corruption? Are
      they not all of vain nature?\u201D\n\nAnd he was called before the throne of
      Light, and God did say unto him: \u201CHast thou considered My servant Job?
      He remaineth upright in his heart.\u201D But the Adversary murmured once more
      and did reply: \u201CSuffer me to touch the work of Thy hands, and Thou shalt
      see if they do not turn away from Thee.\u201D Then the Eternal, in His infinite
      wisdom, permitted the beast to blow upon the creation, not to break them, but
      to prove the free will of the children of Adam.\n\nAnd thereupon, a thousand
      plagues were sent upon the earth, and the men were bowed down under the weight
      of their own misery. In great distress, they did curse the Name of the Eternal,
      and the temples were cast down, and the altars were defiled with the blood
      of hatred. But God was not angry, for He saw the truth in the hearts of His
      creatures.\n\nThen the Deceiver appeared unto them in a form that was not veiled,
      and did say: \u201CI am he whom ye fear, but I am also your salvation. Turn
      ye unto me, and I shall deliver you from the evils of this world.\u201D And
      many among the children of the earth, even the most faithful, did yield to
      his charms, and did forget their first love. And God was grieved in His spirit.\n\nAnd
      it came to pass that He turned His face from the world, and angels fell from
      the sky, and the Adversary did reign over the earth which he had conquered
      by seduction. The light did extinguish from the heavens, and the voice of the
      prophets did cease. The faithful were scattered as seed that is carried away
      by the wind.\n\nAnd it came to pass that the man of God, a servant armed with
      the word and the sword, embarked for a far-off isle, in the forgotten borders
      of earthly kingdoms. For he had heard tell that there did dwell a village,
      the last bastion of the faithful unto the Most High, not yet bowed beneath
      the yoke of the Deceiver."
